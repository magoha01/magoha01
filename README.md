## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹   

I am a former service dog trainer turned aspiring web developer currently navigating their way through BloomTechâ€™s full-stack web developer program, with a projected graduation of April 2022!

At the heart of my training career was my love of creative problem solving, of always getting to be learning something new, and of using my skills to help improve the lives of others. 

 After deciding to change job paths (along with earning my bachelor's degree in cognitive linguistics), I began searching for a career path that utilized my skill set and passions from both my degree and my former profession. I began teaching myself basic HTML and CSS, and found that much of what I learned in terms of studying and analyzing natural languages applied to learning programming languages. Additionally, I love that web development is a versatile field in which there are multiple ways to grow your career.
